1. Any reason why pry-rails gem is listed twice in the Gemfile?
2. Do the underlying sql queries get run every time on call?
3. why belongs_to for prequisites?  can't courses have multiple prerequisites AND be prequisites for multiple courses?
4. can we use the same name ("prerequisites") in both our belongs_to and has_many assoc. definitions?

5. What actions have we taken with our most recent migration?
6. Have we migrated our migration?
7. What actions are we to take with our most recent migration?
8. Where do we specify columns with "t.<insert column name>"?
9. Do we need to specify just one timestamp column in our migration(s)?
10. Does Rails then just know to crate two timestamps columns (i.e. "update" and "create"?)
11. If we haven't specified a timestamps column in our create migration, what do we do?  How do we include it if we're running a add_columns migration?
